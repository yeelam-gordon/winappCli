description: Inspect and interact with running Windows app UIs from the command line using UI Automation (UIA). Use when an AI agent or developer needs to inspect a UI element tree, find controls, take screenshots, click buttons, read or set text, or verify UI state in a running Windows app. Works with any framework WinUI 3, WPF, WinForms, Win32, Electron.
---
## When to use
- Inspecting a running Windows app's UI from the command line
- AI agents interacting with Windows applications (clicking buttons, reading text, taking screenshots)
- Verifying UI state during development or testing
- Automating UI workflows without Playwright or Selenium
- Debugging WinUI 3, WPF, WinForms, Win32, or Electron app UIs

## Prerequisites
- For UIA mode (any app): No setup needed — works with any running Windows app
- For input-injecting verbs (`click`, `hover`, `drag`, `touch`, `pen`, `scroll --wheel`, `send-keys --via send-input`): an **unlocked, interactive desktop** with the target window foregroundable. On a locked/secure desktop they fail fast with `no_interactive_desktop`. The UIA-pattern verbs (`inspect`, `search`, `get-*`, `wait-for`, `set-value`, `invoke`, `scroll --direction/--to`) are headless/locked-session friendly — prefer them in CI.
- `screenshot` is **not** in that group: it always takes an exclusive turn, so it queues behind other UI workflows, and capture can need a usable interactive desktop — the engine restores the target if it is minimized, and falls back to foregrounding it when frame capture is unavailable or `--capture-screen` is used.
- `--capture-screen` needs **exactly one window**. `-w <hwnd>` gives it one: that window's screen region, including anything visibly on top of it. If `-a` matches several top-level or owned windows the command fails with `invalid_arguments` before capturing; run `winapp ui list-windows -a <app>` and retry with `-w <hwnd>`.
- **If other UI workflows may run at the same time**, set one workflow id per logical workflow (see below). Nothing breaks without it, but your commands will not be recognized as belonging together.

## Coordinating with other UI workflows

Windows has one foreground window, one keyboard focus, one cursor, and one input stream. `winapp ui`
therefore makes desktop-driving commands take **cooperative turns** so concurrent workflows cannot
steal each other's focus or dismiss each other's menus. That is always on. Read-only commands never
wait.

Keeping the desktop *across* commands is opt-in — without an id, each command is a one-shot that
releases the desktop the moment it finishes:

```powershell
# Set once per logical UI workflow — same value for cooperating calls, different values for
# independent workflows (even from the same agent).
$env:WINAPP_UI_WORKFLOW_ID = [guid]::NewGuid().ToString()
```

Rules that matter when driving this from an agent:

- **Each tool call usually gets a fresh shell**, and there is no process-ancestry fallback, so
  commands are grouped ONLY by the id you inject. Without it every call is its own workflow.
- **A workflow with an id keeps its turn for four seconds** after its last command. That covers
  back-to-back commands in one script; it deliberately expires while you are reasoning. Treat it as
  a fallback for when you cannot say you are done — not as the way to finish.
- **Run `winapp ui yield` when you finish a known sequence.** It hands the desktop over immediately
  instead of making a waiting workflow sit out a four-second grace nobody needs. Yielding twice, or
  after the grace lapsed, is a harmless success.
- **After a reasoning gap, replay your setup.** Another workflow may have used the desktop, so
  reopen the menu / re-navigate, re-resolve the element, then act. Do not assume transient UI
  survived.
- **Prefer one tight script over many round trips** for a known sequence: `winapp ui invoke View -w
  $hwnd; winapp ui search "Status bar" -w $hwnd; winapp ui click "Status bar" -w $hwnd; winapp ui yield`.
- **`record` shares the turn with its own workflow**, so same-workflow clicks and typing are captured
  while it runs — but only if both commands carry the same id. A `record` with no id blocks everyone
  else for its whole duration.
- **Ordering is owner affinity, then FIFO.** An active workflow may keep issuing commands ahead of
  others already waiting; once it yields or its grace expires, waiters are served in arrival order.
- **Waiting is indefinite and cancellable.** A status line appears after one second; Ctrl+C exits
  `130` with error code `cancelled` and the command never ran.
- **There is no hard cap** — a long script, unbounded recording, or failure loop can block other
  mutating workflows until it finishes or is stopped.

Commands that never wait: `status`, `list-windows`, `inspect`, `search`, `get-*`, `wait-for`.
Commands that wait for the turn but never take the desktop (headless/locked-session friendly):
`set-value`, `scroll-into-view`, `scroll --direction`/`--to`, `record`. They mutate the app, so they
queue behind another workflow. Inside your own workflow they overlap with other shared work — that
is how `record` captures the `set-value` calls it is recording — but they still wait behind an
earlier `DesktopExclusive` command of your own workflow, so a `click` followed by a `set-value` runs
in the order you wrote it.
Commands that take the desktop exclusively: `invoke`, `click`, `drag`, `hover`, `scroll --wheel`,
`touch`, `pen`, `focus`, `send-keys`, `screenshot`.

```powershell
# Finish a workflow deliberately rather than leaving the desktop reserved for four more seconds.
winapp ui yield
```

## Common patterns

### Read within a specific container

```powershell
winapp ui search "Welcome to MyApp" -a myapp --root MailRow --type Text --class-name TextBlock
winapp ui get-value Subject -a myapp --root MailRow --type TextBox
winapp ui wait-for Subject -a myapp --root MailRow --type Edit --value Ready --timeout 10000
```

Use `--root`, `--type`, and `--class-name` together or separately on `search`,
`get-property`, `get-value`, and `wait-for`. The root must be unique; only its
descendants match. `wait-for` re-resolves it every poll, including when it is
initially absent. Type names and literal whole ClassName values ignore case.
The only type aliases are `TextBox` → `Edit` and `TextBlock` → `Text`.
See [Scoped and typed queries](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppCli/blob/main/docs/ui-automation.md#scoped-and-typed-queries)
for the full type vocabulary, boundaries, and error behavior.

### Discover and interact
```powershell
# See what's clickable, then screenshot for context
winapp ui inspect -a myapp --interactive; winapp ui screenshot -a myapp

# Click and verify the page changed
winapp ui invoke btn-settings-a1b2 -a myapp; winapp ui wait-for pn-settingspage-c3d4 -a myapp --timeout 3000; winapp ui screenshot -a myapp

# Fill a form and submit
winapp ui set-value txt-searchbox-e5f6 "hello" -a myapp; winapp ui invoke btn-submit-7a90 -a myapp; winapp ui screenshot -a myapp
```

### Find visible text and click it
```powershell
# Search by text — output shows invokable ancestor
winapp ui search "Save changes" -a myapp
# Output:
#   lbl-savechanges-a1b2 "Save changes" (120,40 80x20)
#         ^ invoke via: btn-save-c3d4 "Save"

# Invoke by text — auto-walks to parent Button
winapp ui invoke 'Save changes' -a myapp
```

### Navigate multi-page apps
```powershell
# Click nav item, wait for page, inspect what's available
winapp ui invoke itm-samples-3f2c -a myapp; winapp ui wait-for pn-samplespage-b4e7 -a myapp; winapp ui inspect -a myapp --interactive
```

### Choose an exact action in tests
```powershell
winapp ui invoke SettingsCategory -a myapp --action select
winapp ui invoke AgreeCheckbox -a myapp --action toggle-on --json
```

Use `--action` to avoid automatic pattern and ancestor fallback. Omit it for the
existing automatic behavior. See the [action reference](https://github.com/microsoft/winappCli/blob/main/docs/ui-automation.md#invoke)
for supported actions, idempotent toggles, and failure recovery, and the
[JSON envelope](references/ui-json-envelope.md#ui-invoke---json) for action results.

### Disambiguate duplicate elements
```powershell
# When text search matches multiple elements, the error shows slugs for each — pick the right one
winapp ui invoke Submit -a myapp
# → Selector matched 3 elements:
#   [0] Button "Submit Order" → btn-submitorder-a1b2
#   [1] Button "Submit" → btn-submit-c3d4
# Use the slug: winapp ui invoke btn-submit-c3d4 -a myapp
```

## Key concepts
- **Selector brackets**: `inspect` and `search` output shows selectors in `[brackets]` — use the bracketed value with other `ui` commands. Selectors are either AutomationId (stable, developer-set) or generated slug (e.g., `btn-name-hash`).
- **AutomationId selectors**: When an element has a unique AutomationId, it becomes the selector directly (e.g., `[MinimizeButton]`). These survive layout changes and localization — preferred for stable targeting.
- **Slug selectors**: When no unique AutomationId exists, a generated slug is used (e.g., `[btn-close-a2b3]`). Format: `prefix-name-hash`. May go stale after UI changes.
- **Plain text search**: `search` and `invoke` accept plain text — `search Minimize` finds elements with "Minimize" in their Name or AutomationId (substring, case-insensitive). No special syntax needed.
- **`--interactive` flag**: Filters to invokable elements only with auto-depth 8 — the fastest way to see what you can click
- **Invokable ancestor surfacing**: When a search result isn't invokable, the nearest invokable parent is shown with its selector
- **`;` chaining**: Chain commands with `;` to run multiple operations in one call, reducing agent round-trips
- **`-a` vs `-w`**: Use `-a` to find apps by name/title/PID. Use `-w <HWND>` for stable window targeting
- **Element markers**: `[on]`/`[off]` for toggles, `[collapsed]`/`[expanded]`, `[scroll:v]`/`[scroll:h]`/`[scroll:vh]` for scrollable containers, `[offscreen]`, `[disabled]`, `value="..."` for editable elements

## Usage

### Connect and discover
```powershell
# Connect and see interactive elements in one call
winapp ui status -a myapp; winapp ui inspect -a myapp --interactive
```

### Inspect element tree
```powershell
winapp ui inspect -a myapp --interactive      # invokable elements only, auto-depth 8
winapp ui inspect -a myapp --depth 5          # deeper tree at depth 5
winapp ui inspect txt-searchbox-e5f6 -a myapp  # subtree rooted at element
winapp ui inspect btn-settings-a1b2 -a myapp --ancestors  # walk up from element to root
winapp ui inspect -a myapp --hide-offscreen   # hide offscreen elements
```

### Find elements
```powershell
winapp ui search Close -a myapp               # finds elements with "Close" in name or automationId
winapp ui search Button -a myapp              # finds elements with "Button" in name (also matches type names)
winapp ui search image -a myapp               # case-insensitive substring match
```

### Screenshot
```powershell
# App screenshot (may include owned windows in a labeled composite)
winapp ui screenshot -a myapp --output page.png

# Crop to element; capture with popups visible
winapp ui screenshot txt-searchbox-e5f6 -a myapp --output search.png
winapp ui list-windows -a myapp # use the main window's HWND below
winapp ui screenshot -w <hwnd> --capture-screen --output with-popups.png

# Bring window to foreground first (matches what the user is currently seeing)
winapp ui screenshot -a myapp --focus --output focused.png
```

Default capture includes owned windows even with an explicit main HWND; it produces one labeled composite, not separate image files. For scope and on-screen overlay placement, see [Screenshot](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppCli/blob/main/docs/ui-automation.md#screenshot). Before switching to screen capture for a missing menu, check [Menus and flyouts in captures](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppCli/blob/main/docs/ui-automation.md#menus-and-flyouts-in-captures), which applies to screenshots and recordings. With `--on sandbox`, the reported screenshot path is the delivered host destination.

### Record video (H.264 MP4)
Record a window or element region to MP4. Prefer a positive `--duration-sec N` for
agents and scripts; otherwise recording waits for a stop signal. npm helpers require
`durationSec` (integer 1–86400). Their abort signal is forceful cancellation, not graceful stop.
```powershell
# Record a window for 10s at 15 fps
winapp ui record -a myapp --duration-sec 10 --fps 15 --output demo.mp4

# Recommended agent evidence: MP4 plus timestamped JPEGs and an NDJSON index
winapp ui record -a myapp --frames --duration-sec 10 --fps 10 --output evidence.mp4 --json

# Include overlays/popups (captures from screen DC; may include occluding windows)
winapp ui record -a myapp --capture-screen --duration-sec 5 --output with-popups.mp4

# Programmatic stop: pipe a newline to stop and finalize the MP4 (for agent/script callers)
"" | winapp ui record -a myapp --json --output capture.mp4
```
- Default `--duration-sec 0` records until Ctrl+C, a newline, or EOF on redirected stdin.
- `--frames` writes `<output-name>.frames` with a manifest, NDJSON index, and changed JPEGs. It supports 1-30 fps and `--max-edge` 64-4096 (default 1280), with a 1 GiB cap. Use `elapsedMs` to bound transitions.
- Existing recording outputs are rejected by default. Use a fresh path, or explicitly
  request `--overwrite` to replace them after the new take finishes. Previous frame
  directories are archived, not deleted. On partial failure, keep the reported evidence
  and follow `recoveryHint`.
- `--capture-screen` captures from the screen DC so overlays and popups are included; the window is brought to the foreground first. When WGC is unavailable and `--capture-screen` is not passed, the CLI returns an error — re-run with `--capture-screen` to consent to screen-DC capture. Because the screen DC captures whatever is genuinely in front, the target's foreground is **verified immediately before capture**; if activation was refused the command fails with `foreground_not_target` and writes nothing rather than returning an image of the wrong window.
- Providing a selector that doesn't match any element fails immediately with `element_not_found` (rather than silently recording the whole window).
- `--json` writes the final result to stdout and one JSON event per line to stderr.

### Hover (for tooltips, flyouts, hover states)
`--dwell-time <ms>` sets how long to wait after hovering (default: 800, range: 0–10000).
```powershell
winapp ui list-windows -a myapp # use the main window's HWND below, not the tooltip's

# Hover to trigger tooltip, then capture it (default 800ms dwell)
winapp ui hover btn-info-a1b2 -a myapp; winapp ui screenshot -w <hwnd> --capture-screen --output tooltip.png

# Longer dwell for apps with slow tooltip timers
winapp ui hover btn-info-a1b2 -a myapp --dwell-time 1200; winapp ui screenshot -w <hwnd> --capture-screen
```

### Send keyboard input
Synthesize keystrokes — the keyboard counterpart to `click`. Use for arrow/Tab/Enter navigation, shortcuts, and per-keystroke typing (vs `set-value`'s atomic write). Tokens are whitespace-separated: named keys (`enter`, `down`, `tab`, `esc`, `f5`), modifier combos (`ctrl+shift+t`), literal text (`hello`), and raw virtual keys (`vk=0xNN`).
```powershell
# Keyboard navigation then commit
winapp ui send-keys "down down enter" -a myapp

# Type the literal words "down down enter" instead of pressing those keys (text= escapes each token)
winapp ui send-keys "text=down text=down text=enter" -a myapp

# Same intent, less typing: --verbatim types the whole argument literally (and keeps exact whitespace)
winapp ui send-keys "down down enter" -a myapp --verbatim

# Shortcut: select all and delete
winapp ui send-keys "ctrl+a delete" -a myapp

# Focus a field, then type text into it
winapp ui send-keys "Hello world" --target txt-name-a1b2 -a myapp

# Transport: --via post-message (default, HWND-targeted, bypasses UIPI) or send-input (OS-wide)
winapp ui send-keys "enter" -a myapp --via send-input

# Fire a global hotkey: win+... is refused by default (acts on the shell); opt in with --allow-system-keys
winapp ui send-keys "win+shift+v" -a myapp --via send-input --allow-system-keys
```
- Default `post-message` is HWND-targeted and works across integrity levels, but can't fire `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` global hotkeys. It automatically retargets to the **focused child control** of the target window, so classic Win32/WinForms child-window controls (e.g. an edit box) receive the input. **WinUI 3 / UWP / XAML controls are windowless and ignore posted `WM_CHAR`/`WM_KEYDOWN`** — post-message can't deliver keys *or* text to them (the command emits a warning and still exits 0, since `PostMessage` can't confirm delivery). Use **`--via send-input`** for WinUI 3 / UWP / XAML apps.
- A token that collides with a key/modifier name (e.g. `enter`, `down`, `ctrl+a`) is pressed as that key. Prefix it with `text=` to type it as literal text instead — `text=enter` types the word "enter"; chain `text=` tokens to type a literal phrase like `text=down text=down text=enter`. Backslash escapes inside a `text=` value type whitespace the tokenizer would otherwise collapse: `\s`→space, `\t`→tab, `\n`→newline, `\r`→CR, `\\`→backslash (e.g. `text=a\s\sb` → "a  b"). When the *whole* argument is literal text, pass `--verbatim` instead of escaping each token: it types the entire keys argument as-is (no key/combo/`vk=`/`text=` parsing) and preserves exact whitespace — `send-keys "down down enter" --verbatim` types the words. (`--verbatim` does not decode backslash escapes; use a `text=` token for control characters.)
- `send-input` is fully real input but goes to the foreground window and is UIPI-blocked when injecting from elevated → AppContainer/AppX. It **rejects system-reserved combos** (`win+l`, `alt+f4`, `ctrl+shift+esc`, `ctrl+alt+del`, `alt+tab`, …) because those act on the OS/shell, not just the target — pass **`--allow-system-keys`** to opt in (e.g. to fire a global hotkey such as PowerToys' `win+shift+v` or `win+r`), or use `--via post-message` (window-scoped) to send one straight to the window. **`win+l` and `ctrl+alt+del` stay blocked even with `--allow-system-keys`** — `win+l` locks the workstation via `LockWorkStation()` (unrecoverable from automation), and `ctrl+alt+del` is a Secure Attention Sequence (SAS) that Windows drops from injected input regardless of the flag, so it errors (`invalid_arguments`) instead of falsely reporting success. On a locked/secure desktop `send-input` fails fast with `no_interactive_desktop`.
- Per-keystroke events: named keys/combos fire a real `KeyDown` on both transports. For literal typed text, `--via send-input` maps each char to its VK (+Shift) so each character fires a real `KeyDown` + OS-composed `WM_CHAR` (`TextChanged`) — use it when downstream logic keys off `KeyDown` (e.g. WinUI 3/WPF `TextBox`); bring the target window to the foreground first. `--via post-message` posts a `WM_CHAR` per character to the focused child control (raises `TextChanged`, lands correct text into classic Win32 controls across integrity levels) but does not fire a per-character `KeyDown`, and — because WinUI 3 / UWP / XAML controls are windowless — does **not** reach them at all (named keys and text alike); use `--via send-input` there.
- Long literal text on `--via send-input` is **auto-throttled**: the text is split into small character chunks injected one `SendInput` at a time with a brief pause between the chunks of that one run, so the target can drain its input queue and every character lands. A single unbroken burst overruns the queue and silently drops characters even though the command reports success. The pacing is scoped to a single long text run — short text, key names, and modifier combos (including sequences like `ctrl+a delete`) inject with no added delay, and the command emits an informational warning when a payload is large enough to be throttled. Because each paced chunk lands on whatever window is foreground, `send-input` re-verifies the target still owns the foreground before every continuation chunk and **aborts with `foreground_not_target`** if focus leaves the target mid-injection, so a focus change partway through can't spray the rest of the text into another window (a focus-changing chord such as `alt+tab` is exempt and is never treated as drift). For large bulk text, prefer `set-value` (atomic, no keystrokes or foreground needed) on controls that support it.

### Drag (reorder, resize, sliders, drag-and-drop)
Press the mouse button at one point, move to another, then release with `drag <from> <to>`, where each endpoint is an element selector (uses its center) or screen `x,y` coordinates from `ui inspect`. Uses `SendInput` with intermediate moves so apps see a realistic `WM_MOUSEMOVE` stream.
```powershell
# Reorder one item onto another (center → center)
winapp ui drag itm-card-9f8e itm-slot-2c1a -a myapp

# Element center → screen coordinates (as reported by `ui inspect`)
winapp ui drag itm-card-9f8e 300,400 -a myapp

# Raw screen coordinates → screen coordinates
winapp ui drag 120,200 480,200 -a myapp

# Right-button drag
winapp ui drag itm-card-9f8e itm-trash-0001 -a myapp --right
```
- A selector drags from/to the element's center; `x,y` are screen coordinates in the same space `ui inspect`/`search` report. Element endpoints are re-resolved just before the drag and fail with `target_moved` if still animating; on a locked/secure desktop the drag fails with `no_interactive_desktop`.

### Touch gestures (tap, swipe, pinch, stretch, long-press)
Inject synthetic touch. The contact anchor is an element selector (its center) or an explicit `--at x,y` screen coordinate. Prefers the modern synthetic-pointer device and falls back to the legacy touch-injection API.
```powershell
# Tap an element center; or tap explicit screen coordinates
winapp ui touch btn-ok-1a2b -a myapp
winapp ui touch -a myapp --at 320,240

# Long-press, swipe, and two-finger pinch/stretch (zoom)
winapp ui touch tile-photo-7b3c -a myapp --gesture long-press --hold-ms 600
winapp ui touch -a myapp --at 100,300 --gesture swipe --to-point 400,300
winapp ui touch img-map-9f8e -a myapp --gesture pinch --distance 200
winapp ui touch img-map-9f8e -a myapp --gesture stretch --distance 200
```
- Gestures: `tap` (default), `double-tap`, `long-press`, `swipe`, `pinch`, `stretch`. `--fingers` 1–10 (pinch/stretch always 2). Refuses without a non-zero foregrounded target (`no_target`/`foreground_not_target`/`no_interactive_desktop`); every coordinate is checked against the target window, and a point outside it produces a non-fatal warning (`warnings[]` in `--json`) while injection still proceeds — consistent with the mouse verbs. If injected touch is unsupported on the device, the command surfaces the real Win32 error rather than a false success. In a Remote Desktop/VM session delivery isn't guaranteed even on exit 0 — the command appends a delivery-uncertainty warning (`warnings[]` in `--json`); verify the effect with a screenshot.

### Pen / stylus (taps and ink strokes)
Inject synthetic pen input (Windows 10 1809+). Target an element center, an explicit `--at`, or a full `--path` ink stroke, with pressure/tilt/eraser control.
```powershell
# Pen tap at element center; firm tap at explicit coords
winapp ui pen canvas-1a2b -a myapp
winapp ui pen -a myapp --at 320,240 --pressure 0.8

# Draw an ink stroke, or erase along one
winapp ui pen -a myapp --path "100,100 150,120 210,140 260,120"
winapp ui pen -a myapp --path "100,100 260,100" --eraser
```
- `--pressure` 0.0–1.0, `--tilt-x`/`--tilt-y` ±90°, `--eraser` for the eraser end. Same injection safety as `touch`: requires a non-zero foregrounded target window and checks every ink point (out-of-window → non-fatal `warnings[]` advisory, injection still proceeds). Pen routing is especially unreliable over Remote Desktop — exit 0 can mean the call succeeded but no pen reached the app; the command appends a delivery-uncertainty warning (`warnings[]` in `--json`). Validate pen flows on a local interactive desktop.

### Read element state
```powershell
# Read text/value content (works for RichEditBox, TextBox, ComboBox, Slider, labels)
winapp ui get-value doc-texteditor-53ad -a notepad
winapp ui get-value SearchBox -a myapp
winapp ui get-value CmbTheme -a myapp              # reads ComboBox selected item via SelectionPattern

# Check toggle/selection state, value, scroll position
winapp ui get-property chk-agreecheckbox-b2c3 -a myapp --property ToggleState
winapp ui get-property txt-textbox-a4b1 -a myapp --property Value
winapp ui get-property cmb-modellist-d5e6 -a myapp --property IsSelected

# Read formatting across the whole text document (not the selection)
winapp ui get-property Document -a myapp --property FontWeight --json

# See what has keyboard focus
winapp ui get-focused -a myapp
```

For `get-focused`, `-a` includes windows in the selected process; `-w` restricts
focus to that exact window, excluding its owned popups. A control can belong to
the target through its parent window even when it omits its own process ID.
See `references/ui-json-envelope.md` for focus no-match and query-error handling.

To check a blank or cleared field, use `winapp ui wait-for SearchBox -a myapp --value ""`.
See [empty-value behavior](https://github.com/microsoft/winappcli/blob/main/docs/ui-automation.md#get-value)
for JSON output and reading the accessibility label separately.

`get-property` also accepts `FontName`, `FontSize`, `ForegroundColor`, `IsItalic`,
and `StrikethroughStyle`. Omit `--property` to include all six formatting attributes.
Treat `Mixed`, `NotSupported`, and `Unavailable` as distinct states, not formatting
values. Names are case-sensitive; unknown names fail with `invalid_arguments`.
See the [formatting reference](https://github.com/microsoft/winappcli/blob/main/docs/ui-automation.md#whole-document-text-formatting)
for units and state meanings, and `references/ui-json-envelope.md` for the JSON shape.

### Set values
To prepare a control for keyboard input, use `winapp ui focus <selector> -a <app>`
(keep `--on sandbox` when working in Sandbox). It activates the control's window
and verifies both foreground and keyboard focus before success. Do not use a
screenshot as a focus workaround. If activation is refused, inspect for a blocking
dialog and ask the user to activate the intended window; do not retry in a loop
or switch to the local desktop. See the [focus reference](https://github.com/microsoft/winappcli/blob/main/docs/ui-automation.md#focus)
for failure codes and recovery.

`set-value` writes programmatically (no keystrokes, no foreground) via a fallback chain: ValuePattern → RangeValuePattern (numeric) → LegacyIAccessible `put_accValue` for TextPattern-only edit controls.
```powershell
winapp ui set-value txt-searchbox-e5f6 "hello" -a myapp        # TextBox/ComboBox via ValuePattern
winapp ui set-value sld-volume-b2c3 75 -a myapp                # Slider via RangeValuePattern
winapp ui set-value doc-compose-9f3a "hello" -a myapp          # RichEdit/compose box via LegacyIAccessible
```
- The LegacyIAccessible fallback reaches rich-edit/compose controls that expose no ValuePattern, as long as their accessibility implements `put_accValue` (native Win32 rich-edit and Chromium/Electron/WebView2 compose boxes typically do).
- **WinUI 3 `RichEditBox` and WPF `RichTextBox` don't support programmatic value-setting** — by design they're read-only to UI Automation's value APIs (Text pattern, no settable Value pattern). `set-value` fails on them with a clear error — use `send-keys` (needs an unlocked, foregrounded desktop) to type into those instead. Note `get-value` can still *read* them via TextPattern.

### Scroll containers
```powershell
# Find scrollable containers — look for [scroll:v] (vertical) or [scroll:h] (horizontal)
winapp ui search scroll -a myapp
# Output:
#   pn-scrollview-bfef Pane "scrollView" [scroll:v] (2127,296 1191x965)
#   pn-scrollviewer-bfb1 Pane "scrollViewer" [scroll:h] (2127,296 1191x216)

# Scroll vertically
winapp ui scroll pn-scrollview-bfef --direction down -a myapp

# Scroll to top/bottom
winapp ui scroll pn-scrollview-bfef --to bottom -a myapp

# Scroll and then inspect for newly visible elements
winapp ui scroll pn-scrollview-bfef --direction down -a myapp; winapp ui search TargetItem -a myapp

# Synthesize real mouse-wheel input over the element (1 = one notch up, -1 = down) — tests wheel handlers (zoom, custom scroll)
winapp ui scroll img-map-a1b2 --wheel -1 -a myapp
```

### Wait for UI state
```powershell
winapp ui wait-for btn-submit-a1b2 -a myapp --timeout 5000
winapp ui wait-for itm-status-c3d4 -a myapp --value "Complete" --timeout 5000
```

## Tips
- Use `--interactive` with `inspect` as your first command — it shows only what you can click
- Chain commands with `;` to reduce round-trips (see note below on why not `&&`)
- Use slugs from output to target specific elements — they're hash-validated and shell-safe
- Use plain text search to find elements: `search Minimize`, `invoke Submit`
- When multiple elements match text search, the error shows slugs for each — pick the right one
- Use `get-property --property ToggleState` to verify checkbox/toggle state after invoke
- `scroll` auto-finds the nearest scrollable parent
- Prefer default [Screenshot](#screenshot) capture for dropdown menus and flyouts; check [Menus and flyouts in captures](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppCli/blob/main/docs/ui-automation.md#menus-and-flyouts-in-captures) before using `-w <hwnd> --capture-screen` when window capture is unavailable or an overlay is outside the target's owned UI
- Follow [Hover](#hover-for-tooltips-flyouts-hover-states) to capture tooltips and hover-triggered UI in place
- Use `--focus` to foreground the target window before capture without switching to screen-DC capture (default capture path uses Windows.Graphics.Capture and works while occluded)
- Use `--hide-disabled` and `--hide-offscreen` to reduce noise

### Why `;` instead of `&&`
Use `;` (not `&&`) to chain commands. PowerShell's `&&` operator can freeze when a native CLI writes to stderr or uses ANSI escape sequences — this causes a pipeline deadlock. `;` runs each command unconditionally and avoids this issue. This is also better for agent workflows: you usually want the screenshot to run even if the invoke had a non-zero exit (to see what went wrong).

### File dialog workaround
File open/save dialogs are standard Windows dialogs with UIA support. Interact with them using existing commands:
```powershell
# 1. Trigger the dialog (e.g., click "Open File" button)
winapp ui invoke btn-openfilebtn-a2b3 -a myapp

# 2. Find the dialog window
winapp ui list-windows -a myapp
# → Shows the main window + the dialog HWND
# Note: untitled zero-size windows are hidden by default; use --show-hidden to include them

# 3. Target the dialog, type the file path, and confirm
winapp ui set-value txt-1148-c4d5 "C:\path\to\file.png" -w <dialog-hwnd>
winapp ui invoke btn-open-e6f7 -w <dialog-hwnd>
```
Note: The filename input in standard file dialogs typically has AutomationId `1148`. Use `inspect -w <dialog-hwnd> --interactive` to discover the actual slugs.

## JSON output envelopes

The `--json` envelope for `ui inspect`, `ui get-focused`, `ui search`, and `ui wait-for` was reshaped in v0.3.1. The DPI context and typed `get-property` element are available in v0.6.3+. Highlights:

- `ui inspect --json` now nests elements under `windows[].elements[]` (was a flat `elements[]`).
- Each inspected window and the `ui status --json` target reports `windowDpi`, `scale`, `dpiAwareness`, and `coordinateSpace: "physical-screen-pixels"`. This is the target window's DPI context. The selected target fails fast on an unreadable DPI instead of defaulting to 96; a secondary window that disappears mid-walk carries `dpiError` and omits the four context fields.
- Successful `ui get-focused --json` queries emit `{ "hasFocus": false }` or `{ "hasFocus": true, "element": {...} }` (was bare `null`); query failures exit nonzero with the standard JSON error on stderr, not a `hasFocus` result.
- `ui search --json` returns `{ "matchCount", "hasMore", "matches" }`; `ui wait-for --json` returns `{ "found", "waitedMs", "element"?, "timedOut" }`.
- `ui get-property --json` preserves `elementId` and its string-valued `properties` map, and adds a typed, scrubbed `element`.
- Typed elements use `type` (not `controlType`) and numeric `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` in physical screen pixels. `0,0,0,0` is UIA's empty/no-displayed-UI rectangle; `isOffscreen` remains independent.
- Search and wait-for elements may include an `invokableAncestor` field (element-shaped).
- Per-element `id`, `parentSelector`, and `windowHandle` are **removed** — use `selector` as the public handle.

## Automating in Windows Sandbox

```powershell
winapp run . --on sandbox --detach
winapp ui inspect --on sandbox -a MyApp
winapp ui screenshot --on sandbox -a MyApp -o .\result.png
```

Use `--detach` before follow-up UI commands, and retain `--on sandbox` with guest PIDs
or window handles. Inject the same `WINAPP_UI_WORKFLOW_ID` into cooperating guest calls;
finish with `winapp ui yield --on sandbox` after all of them complete.

Use `winapp-sandbox` for setup consent, connected-client requirements, brief focus
changes during setup/reconnect, and capture recovery. App screenshots and recordings,
including default filenames and `--frames` directories, return to the host.

## Troubleshooting
| Error | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| "No running app found" | Wrong name or app not running | Try process name, window title, or PID |
| "Multiple windows match" | Several windows match `-a` | Use `-w <HWND>` from the listed options |
| "Selector matched N elements" | Text query matches multiple elements | Use a slug from the suggestions shown in the error, or from `inspect` output |
| "Element may have changed" | Slug hash doesn't match current element | Re-run `inspect` to get fresh slugs |
| "does not support any invoke pattern" | Element can't be invoked | The error shows the invokable ancestor slug if one exists — use that |
| "No UIA window found" | UIA can't see the window | Use `list-windows` to find HWND, then `-w` |
| Popup not in screenshot | Default capture path doesn't include unowned overlays | Follow [Screenshot](#screenshot) to select a window with `-w <hwnd> --capture-screen` |
| `foreground_not_target` from `--capture-screen` | Windows refused the activation (focus-stealing prevention, UAC prompt, another window activating itself), so a screen capture would have recorded the wrong window | Click the target window, close the window that stole focus, then retry — or drop `--capture-screen` to capture the window directly |
| `element_not_found` during record | Selector given but element not in tree | Re-run `inspect` or `search` to get a fresh selector |
| `ambiguous_selector` during record | Plain-text selector matched multiple elements | Use a slug from the suggestions in the error message, or from `inspect` output |
| WGC unavailable during record | WGC capture init failed; no silent fallback | Check GPU/driver; use `--capture-screen` to explicitly request screen DC capture |
