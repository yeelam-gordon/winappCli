The Windows App Development CLI (winapp CLI) is a single command-line interface for managing Windows SDKs, packaging, generating app identity, manifests, certificates, and using build tools with any app framework. This tool bridges the gap between cross-platform development and Windows-native capabilities.
<br/><br/>
Whether you're building with .NET/Win32, CMake, Electron, or Rust, this CLI gives you access to:

- **Modern Windows APIs** - [Windows App SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/) and Windows SDK with automatic setup and code generation
- **Package Identity** - Debug and test by adding package identity without full packaging in a snap
- **MSIX Packaging** - App packaging with signing and Store readiness
- **Developer Tools** - Manifests, certificates, assets, and build integration

Perfect for:

- **Cross-platform developers using frameworks like Qt or Electron** wanting native Windows features or targeting Windows
- **Developers who love their current tools** and want to build Windows apps from VS Code, or any other editor
- **Developers crafting CI/CD pipelines** to automate building apps for Windows

## 🤔 Why?

Many powerful Windows APIs require your app to have package identity, enabling you to leverage some of the OS components Windows offers, that you wouldn't otherwise have access to. With identity, your app gains access to user-first features like notifications, OS integration, and on-device AI.

Our goal is to support developers wherever they are, with the tools and frameworks they already use. Based on feedback from developers shipping cross-platform apps on Windows, we built this CLI to streamline integrating with the Windows developer platform - handling SDK setup, header generation, manifests, certificates, and packaging in just a few commands:

    <img src="./docs/images/before-after-winapp.png" alt="Before: 12 manual steps to access Windows APIs. After: 4 winapp commands (init, create-addon, add-electron-debug-identity, pack)">
  </picture>
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Without winapp CLI, setting up a project involves 12 manual steps—downloading SDKs, generating headers, creating manifests, and more. With the CLI, it's just 4 commands.</i></p>

**Few examples of what package identity and MSIX packaging unlocks:**

- [Interactive native notifications](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/develop/notifications/app-notifications/app-notifications-quickstart?tabs=cs) and notification management

- [Web-to-app linking](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/develop/launch/web-to-app-linking) (`yoursite.com` opens your app)
- [On-device AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/ai/apis/) (Local LLM, Text and Image AI APIs)

- [Startup tasks](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-extensions#start-an-executable-file-when-users-log-into-windows) (launch at Windows login)

## 📦 Installation

### WinGet <img src="https://img.shields.io/winget/v/Microsoft.WinAppCli?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows&color=357EC7" alt="WinGet" height="24">

The easiest way to use the CLI is via WinGet (Windows Package Manager). In Terminal, simply run:

`winget install Microsoft.winappcli --source winget`

Or, if you prefer a PowerShell terminal, you can use the WinGet PowerShell cmdlet (from the `Microsoft.WinGet.Client` module):

`Install-WinGetPackage Microsoft.winappcli`

### NPM <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/winappcli"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40microsoft%2Fwinappcli?style=for-the-badge&logo=npm" alt="NPM" height="24"></a>


You can install the CLI for Electron projects via NPM:

`npm install @microsoft/winappcli --save-dev`

### GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps

For CI/CD pipelines on GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps, use the [`setup-WinAppCli`](https://github.com/microsoft/setup-WinAppCli?tab=readme-ov-file#setup-windows-app-developer-cli) action to automatically install the CLI on your runners/agents.

## 🧩 VS Code Extension

The **[WinApp VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Microsoft-WinAppCLI.winapp)** brings WinApp CLI into Visual Studio Code. It can initialize projects, debug with package identity, package, sign, and more without leaving the editor. Press **F5** to launch your app with identity and automatically attach a debugger.

Install it from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Microsoft-WinAppCLI.winapp). Checkout the repo for the WinApp VS Code Extension at [microsoft/WinAppVSCE](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppVSCE).

## 🤖 Using with AI Coding Agents

AI coding agents (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, etc.) auto-discover skill files in your project.

**GitHub Copilot CLI Plugin** (global — works across all projects)
```bash
copilot plugin install microsoft/WinAppCli
```

**Claude Code** — Claude Code auto-discovers skills and agents from the in-repo [`.claude/`](./.claude/) directory shipped in this repository. No install step required; just open the repo in Claude Code.

This gives agents full understanding of winapp commands, workflows, and troubleshooting.
