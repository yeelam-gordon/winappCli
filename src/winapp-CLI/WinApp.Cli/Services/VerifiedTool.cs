/// the file, nor rename or delete any directory above it.

/// A handle alone is not quite enough, because it pins the file rather than the path. If a directory
/// along the way is a junction, deleting and re-creating it re-points the original path at another
/// file while the handle stays valid, and the path would launch that one instead. <see cref="Path"/>
/// is therefore resolved from the handle itself, with every junction already followed, and is what
