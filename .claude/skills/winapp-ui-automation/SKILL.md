description: Inspect and interact with running Windows app UIs from the command line using UI Automation (UIA). Use when an AI agent or developer needs to inspect a UI element tree, find controls, take screenshots, click buttons, read or set text, or verify UI state in a running Windows app. Works with any framework WinUI 3, WPF, WinForms, Win32, Electron.
version: 0.4.1
---
## When to use
- Inspecting a running Windows app's UI from the command line
- AI agents interacting with Windows applications (clicking buttons, reading text, taking screenshots)
- Verifying UI state during development or testing
- Automating UI workflows without Playwright or Selenium
- Debugging WinUI 3, WPF, WinForms, Win32, or Electron app UIs

## Prerequisites
- For UIA mode (any app): No setup needed — works with any running Windows app
- For input-injecting verbs (`click`, `hover`, `drag`, `scroll --wheel`, `send-keys --via send-input`): an **unlocked, interactive desktop** with the target window foregroundable. On a locked/secure desktop they fail fast with `no_interactive_desktop`. The UIA-pattern verbs (`inspect`, `search`, `get-*`, `wait-for`, `set-value`, `invoke`, `scroll --direction/--to`, `screenshot`) are headless/locked-session friendly — prefer them in CI.

## Common patterns

### Discover and interact
```powershell
# See what's clickable, then screenshot for context
winapp ui inspect -a myapp --interactive; winapp ui screenshot -a myapp

# Click and verify the page changed
winapp ui invoke btn-settings-a1b2 -a myapp; winapp ui wait-for pn-settingspage-c3d4 -a myapp --timeout 3000; winapp ui screenshot -a myapp

# Fill a form and submit
winapp ui set-value txt-searchbox-e5f6 "hello" -a myapp; winapp ui invoke btn-submit-7a90 -a myapp; winapp ui screenshot -a myapp
```

### Find visible text and click it
```powershell
# Search by text — output shows invokable ancestor
winapp ui search "Save changes" -a myapp
# Output:
#   lbl-savechanges-a1b2 "Save changes" (120,40 80x20)
#         ^ invoke via: btn-save-c3d4 "Save"

# Invoke by text — auto-walks to parent Button
winapp ui invoke 'Save changes' -a myapp
```

### Navigate multi-page apps
```powershell
# Click nav item, wait for page, inspect what's available
winapp ui invoke itm-samples-3f2c -a myapp; winapp ui wait-for pn-samplespage-b4e7 -a myapp; winapp ui inspect -a myapp --interactive
```

### Disambiguate duplicate elements
```powershell
# When text search matches multiple elements, the error shows slugs for each — pick the right one
winapp ui invoke Submit -a myapp
# → Selector matched 3 elements:
#   [0] Button "Submit Order" → btn-submitorder-a1b2
#   [1] Button "Submit" → btn-submit-c3d4
# Use the slug: winapp ui invoke btn-submit-c3d4 -a myapp
```

## Key concepts
- **Selector brackets**: `inspect` and `search` output shows selectors in `[brackets]` — use the bracketed value with other `ui` commands. Selectors are either AutomationId (stable, developer-set) or generated slug (e.g., `btn-name-hash`).
- **AutomationId selectors**: When an element has a unique AutomationId, it becomes the selector directly (e.g., `[MinimizeButton]`). These survive layout changes and localization — preferred for stable targeting.
- **Slug selectors**: When no unique AutomationId exists, a generated slug is used (e.g., `[btn-close-a2b3]`). Format: `prefix-name-hash`. May go stale after UI changes.
- **Plain text search**: `search` and `invoke` accept plain text — `search Minimize` finds elements with "Minimize" in their Name or AutomationId (substring, case-insensitive). No special syntax needed.
- **`--interactive` flag**: Filters to invokable elements only with auto-depth 8 — the fastest way to see what you can click
- **Invokable ancestor surfacing**: When a search result isn't invokable, the nearest invokable parent is shown with its selector
- **`;` chaining**: Chain commands with `;` to run multiple operations in one call, reducing agent round-trips
- **`-a` vs `-w`**: Use `-a` to find apps by name/title/PID. Use `-w <HWND>` for stable window targeting
- **Element markers**: `[on]`/`[off]` for toggles, `[collapsed]`/`[expanded]`, `[scroll:v]`/`[scroll:h]`/`[scroll:vh]` for scrollable containers, `[offscreen]`, `[disabled]`, `value="..."` for editable elements

## Usage

### Connect and discover
```powershell
# Connect and see interactive elements in one call
winapp ui status -a myapp; winapp ui inspect -a myapp --interactive
```

### Inspect element tree
```powershell
winapp ui inspect -a myapp --interactive      # invokable elements only, auto-depth 8
winapp ui inspect -a myapp --depth 5          # deeper tree at depth 5
winapp ui inspect txt-searchbox-e5f6 -a myapp  # subtree rooted at element
winapp ui inspect btn-settings-a1b2 -a myapp --ancestors  # walk up from element to root
winapp ui inspect -a myapp --hide-offscreen   # hide offscreen elements
```

### Find elements
```powershell
winapp ui search Close -a myapp               # finds elements with "Close" in name or automationId
winapp ui search Button -a myapp              # finds elements with "Button" in name (also matches type names)
winapp ui search image -a myapp               # case-insensitive substring match
```

### Screenshot
```powershell
# Full window screenshot
winapp ui screenshot -a myapp --output page.png

# Crop to element; capture with popups visible
winapp ui screenshot txt-searchbox-e5f6 -a myapp --output search.png
winapp ui screenshot -a myapp --capture-screen --output with-popups.png

# Bring window to foreground first (matches what the user is currently seeing)
winapp ui screenshot -a myapp --focus --output focused.png
```

### Hover (for tooltips, flyouts, hover states)
`--dwell-time <ms>` sets how long to wait after hovering (default: 800, range: 0–10000).
```powershell
# Hover to trigger tooltip, then capture it (default 800ms dwell)
winapp ui hover btn-info-a1b2 -a myapp; winapp ui screenshot -a myapp --capture-screen --output tooltip.png

# Longer dwell for apps with slow tooltip timers
winapp ui hover btn-info-a1b2 -a myapp --dwell-time 1200; winapp ui screenshot -a myapp --capture-screen
```

### Send keyboard input
Synthesize keystrokes — the keyboard counterpart to `click`. Use for arrow/Tab/Enter navigation, shortcuts, and per-keystroke typing (vs `set-value`'s atomic write). Tokens are whitespace-separated: named keys (`enter`, `down`, `tab`, `esc`, `f5`), modifier combos (`ctrl+shift+t`), literal text (`hello`), and raw virtual keys (`vk=0xNN`).
```powershell
# Keyboard navigation then commit
winapp ui send-keys "down down enter" -a myapp

# Type the literal words "down down enter" instead of pressing those keys (text= escapes each token)
winapp ui send-keys "text=down text=down text=enter" -a myapp

# Same intent, less typing: --verbatim types the whole argument literally (and keeps exact whitespace)
winapp ui send-keys "down down enter" -a myapp --verbatim

# Shortcut: select all and delete
winapp ui send-keys "ctrl+a delete" -a myapp

# Focus a field, then type text into it
winapp ui send-keys "Hello world" --target txt-name-a1b2 -a myapp

# Transport: --via post-message (default, HWND-targeted, bypasses UIPI) or send-input (OS-wide)
winapp ui send-keys "enter" -a myapp --via send-input
```
- Default `post-message` is HWND-targeted and works across integrity levels, but can't fire `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` global hotkeys; for classic Win32/WinForms child-window controls, target the control with `-w`/`--target`.
- A token that collides with a key/modifier name (e.g. `enter`, `down`, `ctrl+a`) is pressed as that key. Prefix it with `text=` to type it as literal text instead — `text=enter` types the word "enter"; chain `text=` tokens to type a literal phrase like `text=down text=down text=enter`. Backslash escapes inside a `text=` value type whitespace the tokenizer would otherwise collapse: `\s`→space, `\t`→tab, `\n`→newline, `\r`→CR, `\\`→backslash (e.g. `text=a\s\sb` → "a  b"). When the *whole* argument is literal text, pass `--verbatim` instead of escaping each token: it types the entire keys argument as-is (no key/combo/`vk=`/`text=` parsing) and preserves exact whitespace — `send-keys "down down enter" --verbatim` types the words. (`--verbatim` does not decode backslash escapes; use a `text=` token for control characters.)
- `send-input` is fully real input but goes to the foreground window and is UIPI-blocked when injecting from elevated → AppContainer/AppX. It **rejects system-reserved combos** (`win+l`, `alt+f4`, `ctrl+shift+esc`, `ctrl+alt+del`, `alt+tab`, …) because those act on the OS/shell, not just the target — use `--via post-message` (window-scoped) if you really need to send one to the window. On a locked/secure desktop `send-input` fails fast with `no_interactive_desktop`.
- Per-keystroke events: named keys/combos fire a real `KeyDown` on both transports. For literal typed text, `--via send-input` maps each char to its VK (+Shift) so each character fires a real `KeyDown` + OS-composed `WM_CHAR` (`TextChanged`) — use it when downstream logic keys off `KeyDown` (e.g. WinUI 3/WPF `TextBox`); bring the target window to the foreground first. `--via post-message` posts `WM_CHAR` (raises `TextChanged`, lands correct text across integrity levels) but does not fire a per-character `KeyDown`.

### Drag (reorder, resize, sliders, drag-and-drop)
Press the mouse button at one point, move to another, then release with `drag <from> <to>`, where each endpoint is an element selector (uses its center) or app `x,y` coordinates from `ui inspect`. Uses `SendInput` with intermediate moves so apps see a realistic `WM_MOUSEMOVE` stream.
```powershell
# Reorder one item onto another (center → center)
winapp ui drag itm-card-9f8e itm-slot-2c1a -a myapp

# Element center → app coordinates (as reported by `ui inspect`)
winapp ui drag itm-card-9f8e 300,400 -a myapp

# Raw app coordinates → app coordinates
winapp ui drag 120,200 480,200 -a myapp

# Right-button drag
winapp ui drag itm-card-9f8e itm-trash-0001 -a myapp --right
```
- A selector drags from/to the element's center; `x,y` are app coordinates in the same space `ui inspect`/`search` report. Element endpoints are re-resolved just before the drag and fail with `target_moved` if still animating; on a locked/secure desktop the drag fails with `no_interactive_desktop`.

### Read element state
```powershell
# Read text/value content (works for RichEditBox, TextBox, ComboBox, Slider, labels)
winapp ui get-value doc-texteditor-53ad -a notepad
winapp ui get-value SearchBox -a myapp
winapp ui get-value CmbTheme -a myapp              # reads ComboBox selected item via SelectionPattern

# Check toggle/selection state, value, scroll position
winapp ui get-property chk-agreecheckbox-b2c3 -a myapp --property ToggleState
winapp ui get-property txt-textbox-a4b1 -a myapp --property Value
winapp ui get-property cmb-modellist-d5e6 -a myapp --property IsSelected

# See what has keyboard focus
winapp ui get-focused -a myapp
```

### Scroll containers
```powershell
# Find scrollable containers — look for [scroll:v] (vertical) or [scroll:h] (horizontal)
winapp ui search scroll -a myapp
# Output:
#   pn-scrollview-bfef Pane "scrollView" [scroll:v] (2127,296 1191x965)
#   pn-scrollviewer-bfb1 Pane "scrollViewer" [scroll:h] (2127,296 1191x216)

# Scroll vertically
winapp ui scroll pn-scrollview-bfef --direction down -a myapp

# Scroll to top/bottom
winapp ui scroll pn-scrollview-bfef --to bottom -a myapp

# Scroll and then inspect for newly visible elements
winapp ui scroll pn-scrollview-bfef --direction down -a myapp; winapp ui search TargetItem -a myapp

# Synthesize real mouse-wheel input over the element (1 = one notch up, -1 = down) — tests wheel handlers (zoom, custom scroll)
winapp ui scroll img-map-a1b2 --wheel -1 -a myapp
```

### Wait for UI state
```powershell
winapp ui wait-for btn-submit-a1b2 -a myapp --timeout 5000
winapp ui wait-for itm-status-c3d4 -a myapp --value "Complete" --timeout 5000
```

### Audit accessibility & contrast
```powershell
# Audit the whole window (all areas, basic level) — exits non-zero if any FAIL is found (CI gate)
winapp ui audit -a myapp

# Machine-readable report ({ summary, issues }); write it to a file too
winapp ui audit -a myapp --json -o audit.json

# Scope to specific areas (repeatable). Areas: names, keyboard, screen-reader, contrast, roles
winapp ui audit -a myapp --area names --area keyboard

# Go deeper: 'thorough' (alias: 'aaa') adds heuristic rules and applies WCAG AAA contrast
winapp ui audit -a myapp --level thorough

# Contrast only, at the default basic level (alias: 'aa'; WCAG AA thresholds)
winapp ui audit -a myapp --area contrast --level aa
```
- `--area` selects one or more audit areas (default: all). Contrast requires a window pixel capture; it is measured only when the `contrast` area is selected.
- `--level basic` (default; alias `aa`) runs fast essential rules with WCAG **AA** contrast thresholds (normal 4.5, large 3.0); `--level thorough` (alias `aaa`) adds heuristic/deeper rules (e.g. keyboard tab-order) and applies WCAG **AAA** contrast thresholds (normal 7.0, large 4.5).
- Non-client chrome (title-bar caption buttons, scrollbar parts) is suppressed from locale-invariant UIA `ControlType` ancestry rather than English accessible names, including for selector-scoped audits. Providers that flatten or omit those relationships remain auditable instead of being guessed from localized text. The same defect surfaced by multiple areas is de-duplicated, so counts aren't inflated.
- The audit is a static snapshot of the UI Automation elements currently exposed by the target window. The `screen-reader` area checks static UIA name, role, and focus readiness; it does not drive a screen reader or navigate application states.
- A supplied selector that no longer resolves returns `element_not_found`; the audit never widens to the root window. UIA traversal and app-window discovery are cooperatively cancellable and bounded. Provider child/sibling failures, depth truncation, and element/time limits become explicit audit failures. Checks occur between provider/native calls; a call already in progress cannot be forcibly interrupted.
- Contrast capture uses Windows.Graphics.Capture only, rejects captures above 16,777,216 pixels before large frame/buffer allocations, and shares a 10-second cooperative capture-and-analysis budget. The audit does not use the potentially blocking `PrintWindow` fallback retained by the standalone screenshot command, so unavailable or failed capture is fail-closed.
- Contrast analysis uses at most 65,536 deterministic samples per candidate and 4,194,304 samples per audit with a fixed luminance histogram. It considers provider `Text` nodes plus common controls that render their own accessible `Name`/`Value` (including populated edits and leaf/interactive UIA `Custom` controls), while preferring visible child `Text` nodes to avoid duplicates. Visible provider text with zero/invalid bounds remains eligible and fails as unmeasured. The audit uses the normal-text threshold because UIA bounds do not reliably expose glyph size.
- Human output and JSON `summary.contrast` report `attempted`, `measured`, and `unmeasured` candidate counts. Source-window boundaries prevent pixels from another top-level window from being substituted, while child native HWND controls remain eligible for the root capture. Detailed contrast findings are capped at 100 plus an aggregate omission finding, while coverage counts remain complete. Every unmeasured eligible candidate is a failure and exits non-zero. A view with no eligible visible text candidates is reported explicitly and is not itself a failure.
- If no UIA elements are found, the audit reports a failure instead of a clean result.
- Summary `pass` counts are successful individual rule checks, not elements. This command is quick heuristic lint, not WCAG or accessibility certification. Supplement it with manual testing and maintained tools such as [Accessibility Insights for Windows](https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/windows/overview/) or [Axe.Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/axe-windows) for comprehensive rule coverage.

## Tips
- Use `--interactive` with `inspect` as your first command — it shows only what you can click
- Chain commands with `;` to reduce round-trips (see note below on why not `&&`)
- Use slugs from output to target specific elements — they're hash-validated and shell-safe
- Use plain text search to find elements: `search Minimize`, `invoke Submit`
- When multiple elements match text search, the error shows slugs for each — pick the right one
- Use `get-property --property ToggleState` to verify checkbox/toggle state after invoke
- `scroll` auto-finds the nearest scrollable parent
- Use `--capture-screen` to capture popup overlays, dropdown menus, and flyouts (also brings the window to the foreground)
- Use `hover` before `screenshot --capture-screen` to capture tooltips and hover-triggered UI
- Use `--focus` to foreground the target window before capture without switching to screen-DC capture (default capture path uses Windows.Graphics.Capture and works while occluded)
- Use `--hide-disabled` and `--hide-offscreen` to reduce noise

### Why `;` instead of `&&`
Use `;` (not `&&`) to chain commands. PowerShell's `&&` operator can freeze when a native CLI writes to stderr or uses ANSI escape sequences — this causes a pipeline deadlock. `;` runs each command unconditionally and avoids this issue. This is also better for agent workflows: you usually want the screenshot to run even if the invoke had a non-zero exit (to see what went wrong).

### File dialog workaround
File open/save dialogs are standard Windows dialogs with UIA support. Interact with them using existing commands:
```powershell
# 1. Trigger the dialog (e.g., click "Open File" button)
winapp ui invoke btn-openfilebtn-a2b3 -a myapp

# 2. Find the dialog window
winapp ui list-windows -a myapp
# → Shows the main window + the dialog HWND
# Note: untitled zero-size windows are hidden by default; use --show-hidden to include them

# 3. Target the dialog, type the file path, and confirm
winapp ui set-value txt-1148-c4d5 "C:\path\to\file.png" -w <dialog-hwnd>
winapp ui invoke btn-open-e6f7 -w <dialog-hwnd>
```
Note: The filename input in standard file dialogs typically has AutomationId `1148`. Use `inspect -w <dialog-hwnd> --interactive` to discover the actual slugs.

## JSON output envelopes (v0.3.1+)

The `--json` envelope for `ui inspect`, `ui get-focused`, `ui search`, and `ui wait-for` was reshaped in v0.3.1. Pre-0.3.1 parsers will silently break — most fields were renamed, removed, or moved into envelopes. Highlights:

- `ui inspect --json` now nests elements under `windows[].elements[]` (was a flat `elements[]`).
- `ui get-focused --json` always emits an envelope — `{ "hasFocus": false }` or `{ "hasFocus": true, "element": {...} }` (was bare `null`).
- `ui search --json` / `ui wait-for --json` may include an `invokableAncestor` field (element-shaped) on each match.
- Per-element `id`, `parentSelector`, and `windowHandle` are **removed** — use `selector` as the public handle.

## Troubleshooting
| Error | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| "No running app found" | Wrong name or app not running | Try process name, window title, or PID |
| "Multiple windows match" | Several windows match `-a` | Use `-w <HWND>` from the listed options |
| "Selector matched N elements" | Text query matches multiple elements | Use a slug from the suggestions shown in the error, or from `inspect` output |
| "Element may have changed" | Slug hash doesn't match current element | Re-run `inspect` to get fresh slugs |
| "does not support any invoke pattern" | Element can't be invoked | The error shows the invokable ancestor slug if one exists — use that |
| "No UIA window found" | UIA can't see the window | Use `list-windows` to find HWND, then `-w` |
| Popup not in screenshot | Default capture path doesn't include unowned overlays | Use `--capture-screen` flag |

| `--app` | Target app (process name, window title, or PID). Lists windows if ambiguous. | (none) |
| `--dwell-ms` | Milliseconds to dwell at the destination after moving, before releasing (default: 0). Lets drop targets / merge overlays that arm from a sustained hover latch before release. | (none) |
| `--hold-ms` | Milliseconds to hold the button down at the start before moving (default: 0). With <from> == <to> (no movement) this performs a press-and-hold / long-press gesture. | (none) |
| `--json` | Format output as JSON | (none) |
| `--right` | Drag with the right mouse button instead of the left button | (none) |
| `--window` | Target window by HWND (stable handle from list output). Takes precedence over --app. | (none) |

### `winapp ui hover`

Move the mouse to an element's center to trigger hover effects (tooltips, flyouts, visual states). Uses SendInput for realistic mouse movement and waits for a configurable dwell time.

#### Arguments
<!-- auto-generated from cli-schema.json -->
| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `<selector>` | No | Semantic slug (e.g., btn-minimize-d1a0) or text to search by name/automationId |

#### Options
<!-- auto-generated from cli-schema.json -->
| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--app` | Target app (process name, window title, or PID). Lists windows if ambiguous. | (none) |
| `--dwell-time` | Time in milliseconds to wait after hovering for hover effects to appear (default: 800) | `800` |
| `--json` | Format output as JSON | (none) |
| `--window` | Target window by HWND (stable handle from list output). Takes precedence over --app. | (none) |

### `winapp ui send-keys`

Send synthetic keyboard input to a window. Supports named keys (down, enter, tab), modifier combos (ctrl+shift+t), raw virtual keys (vk=0xNN), and literal text. Use --verbatim to type the whole argument literally, or --target to focus an element first. Two transports via --via: post-message (default, HWND-targeted, bypasses UIPI) or send-input (OS-wide). For per-keystroke KeyDown on typed text (e.g. a WinUI 3/WPF TextBox), use --via send-input.

#### Arguments
<!-- auto-generated from cli-schema.json -->
| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `<keys>` | No | Keys to send. Whitespace-separated tokens: named keys (down, enter, tab, esc, f5), modifier combos (ctrl+shift+t, alt+f4), raw virtual keys (vk=0x42), or literal text (hello). Use text=<literal> to type a single value verbatim when it would otherwise be read as a key name or combo (text=enter types "enter"; text=ctrl+a types "ctrl+a"); backslash escapes \s \t \n \r \\ are supported (text=a\s\sb types "a  b"). To type the whole argument literally without escaping each token, pass --verbatim instead. Quote multi-token strings, e.g. "ctrl+a delete". |

#### Options
<!-- auto-generated from cli-schema.json -->
| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--app` | Target app (process name, window title, or PID). Lists windows if ambiguous. | (none) |
| `--json` | Format output as JSON | (none) |
| `--target` | Optional selector (slug or text) to focus before sending keys. | (none) |
| `--verbatim` | Type the entire keys argument as literal text — no named-key, combo, or vk= interpretation, and exact whitespace preserved. The whole-argument form of the per-token text= escape: --verbatim "down down enter" types the words instead of pressing Down, Down, Enter. | (none) |
| `--via` | Transport: post-message (default, HWND-targeted, bypasses UIPI; typed text raises TextChanged but not a per-character KeyDown) or send-input (OS-wide; typed text raises a real per-character KeyDown + TextChanged). Named keys and combos raise KeyDown on both, but keyboard accelerators/shortcuts (KeyboardAccelerator, e.g. ctrl+t) only fire via send-input. | `post-message` |
| `--window` | Target window by HWND (stable handle from list output). Takes precedence over --app. | (none) |

### `winapp ui audit`

Quick-lint the currently visible view of a running app for accessibility and contrast issues. Walks the element tree and evaluates modular audit areas (names, keyboard, static screen-reader readiness, contrast, roles) at a chosen level (basic/thorough). Audits one view at a time — it does not navigate; drive the other ui commands (invoke, send-keys) to move through other pages/tabs/states and audit each. This heuristic lint is not accessibility certification. Exits non-zero when any fail-severity issue is found or a requested check cannot run, so it can gate CI.
